# Pomodoro-Timer-App
This is an app that you can use while studying to adhere to the "Pomodoro Technique"
The app works like this: we work for 25 minutes then take a break for 5 miuntes
We repeat this 4 times, but after 4 periods of work we then take a long break of 20 minutes.
The timer plays a ding sound effect to notify you whenever a break of work period ends.
